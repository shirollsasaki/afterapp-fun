title: "Byju's Collapse Is a Preview of What AI Does to Education Apps"
description: "The $22 billion edtech giant didn't lose to a competitor — it lost to a paradigm shift. When ChatGPT can tutor better than pre-recorded videos, every education app is on borrowed time."

The numbers tell a story that should terrify every edtech founder in India. Byju's — once valued at $22 billion, India's most celebrated startup — had its app delisted from Google Play in May 2025 over unpaid AWS bills. The company entered insolvency proceedings. The dream is dead.

But here's what most post-mortems get wrong: Byju's didn't fail because of bad management alone. It failed because its core product — structured video content explaining concepts — became *commodity knowledge* the moment ChatGPT could explain the same concepts conversationally, personalized to each student, for free.

## The $22 Billion Question

Byju's built its empire on a simple insight: Indian students need high-quality explanations of academic concepts, and most don't have access to great teachers. Video-based learning was the solution.

That insight was correct in 2015. By 2025, it was obsolete.

When a student can ask ChatGPT "explain quadratic equations like I'm 15 and struggle with math," and receive a patient, adaptive, infinitely-available tutor — why would they watch a pre-recorded video? The video can't answer follow-up questions. It can't slow down. It can't detect confusion.

**AI tutors deliver what video courses promised but couldn't: true personalization at scale.**

## The Domino Effect

Byju's is the most dramatic casualty, but the pattern extends across Indian edtech:

- **Unacademy** saw revenue decline 7% with a teacher exodus and leadership vacuum
- **Vedantu** faces similar pressures from AI-first alternatives
- **Physics Wallah** has more resilience due to its community-first approach, but isn't immune

Antler, a prominent VC firm, has identified education as the "most promising sector for AI disruption in India in 2026." Not promising for incumbents — promising for AI-native replacements.

## What AI Education Actually Looks Like

The replacement isn't a single app. It's a conversation. Consider what a student can do today with a general-purpose AI:

1. **Explain any concept** at any difficulty level, in any language
2. **Generate practice problems** customized to weak areas
3. **Grade and explain** why answers are wrong
4. **Adapt in real time** to the student's comprehension
5. **Available 24/7** without subscription fatigue

This is the BYOA (Build Your Own App) thesis applied to education: a single AI assistant configured for "student mode" replaces what previously required downloading Byju's, Unacademy, Doubtnut, and three other apps.

## The Revenue Moat Problem

India's edtech market has a fundamental weakness: per-user spending is abysmal. When your average customer pays less than $5 annually for apps, you need massive scale to survive. Byju's tried to solve this with aggressive sales tactics and high-ticket courses — a strategy that worked until a better free alternative appeared.

AI tutors have near-zero marginal cost per student. An edtech app charging ₹5,000/year for test prep is competing against ChatGPT at $0.

## What Survives

Not everything dies. Education companies with these characteristics survive the AI disruption:

- **Physical infrastructure** (coaching centers with real classrooms)
- **Credentialing power** (university degrees, certifications)
- **Community and peer learning** (Physics Wallah's strength)
- **Proprietary assessment data** (real exam question banks)

The pattern is clear: information delivery dies, infrastructure survives. If your entire value proposition is "we explain things well" — you're already dead. You just don't know it yet.
