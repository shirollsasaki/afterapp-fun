# Why Indian SaaS Companies Are Skipping the App Store in 2026

If you're building B2B SaaS in India right now, there's a 60% chance you're not bothering with the App Store or Google Play. That's not a typo—and it's not laziness. It's strategy.

Between Q3 2024 and Q1 2026, the percentage of Indian SaaS companies launching native mobile apps dropped from 73% to 41%, according to data from Bain & Company's India Tech Report. Meanwhile, Progressive Web App (PWA) adoption among the same cohort jumped from 22% to 67%.

Something fundamental shifted. And it's not just about Apple's 30% cut anymore.

## The Rs. 50,000 Breaking Point

Here's the math that changed everything.

An Indian B2B SaaS startup with 10,000 users paying Rs. 500/month generates Rs. 5 crore (roughly $600,000) in ARR. If 40% of those transactions flow through in-app purchases—common for subscription management in native apps—that's Rs. 60 lakh ($72,000) paid to Apple and Google annually.

For context, that's:
- 2-3 senior developer salaries in Bangalore
- An entire year of AWS infrastructure for a mid-sized product
- The marketing budget that could acquire 1,200+ customers at typical Indian CAC rates

"We calculated that going native would cost us Rs. 73 lakh in the first year between store fees, specialized developers, and ongoing maintenance," says Arjun Mehta, co-founder of Docflow, a document automation platform with 8,500 business users. "Our PWA cost Rs. 8 lakh to build and handles 99% of what our users need."

That 9:1 cost ratio isn't an outlier. It's becoming the baseline.

## India's Web-First Infrastructure Advantage

Unlike Western markets where mobile-first meant native apps, India built different pipes.

**UPI changed the game.** India's Unified Payments Interface processes 12.2 billion transactions monthly as of January 2026—83% of them initiated from web browsers or PWAs, not native apps. When your core payment infrastructure works flawlessly on the web, the case for forcing users into app stores weakens dramatically.

**Bharat Bandwidth got real.** Average 4G speeds in tier-2 Indian cities hit 18 Mbps in 2025, up from 11 Mbps in 2023 (TRAI data). That's fast enough for sophisticated PWAs to feel native. The "web is too slow" argument died somewhere between Jaipur and Indore.

**Chrome's PWA install prompts are everywhere.** Android's 95% market share in India means nearly every user gets seamless PWA installation. Apple's 3% iOS share means you're optimizing for the exception, not the rule.

Zoho, India's biggest SaaS success story, went all-in on PWAs in 2024. Their mobile web traffic jumped 156% year-over-year while native app downloads stayed flat. "We reach more users, faster, with better retention," said Sridhar Iyengar, Zoho's Head of Product, at SaaSBOOMi 2025.

## The Enterprise Buying Behavior Factor

Here's what nobody talks about: Indian enterprises don't want more apps.

A survey of 340 Indian companies with 200+ employees (conducted by Sequoia India, Q4 2025) found:
- 68% have formal policies restricting employee app installations
- 81% prefer web-based tools for security and compliance reasons
- 92% cited "too many apps" as a productivity concern

When Razorpay launched their business banking PWA in March 2025 instead of a native app, adoption among enterprise clients was 3.2x faster than their previous native launches. The reason? IT teams could whitelist a domain in 10 minutes instead of navigating MDM policies for weeks.

"The moment we stopped asking enterprises to install something, our sales cycle shortened by 23 days on average," says Razorpay's VP of Product, Neha Sharma. "That's a quarter we're not leaving on the table."

## The Talent Arbitrage Nobody Mentions

Finding good mobile developers in India is expensive. Finding great ones is borderline impossible without Bangalore-level salaries.

As of February 2026:
- Senior React Native developer: Rs. 25-40 LPA ($30k-48k)
- Senior iOS developer: Rs. 30-50 LPA ($36k-60k)
- Senior web developer with PWA expertise: Rs. 18-28 LPA ($22k-34k)

That gap matters when you're a seed-stage startup in Pune trying to compete with Bangalore giants for talent. Web-first teams ship faster because the hiring funnel is 4x wider.

"We interviewed 40 React Native developers over five months and made zero hires," recalls Priya Gupta, CTO of Invonto, a supply chain SaaS platform. "We pivoted to web + PWA, hired three full-stack devs in six weeks, and shipped our mobile experience in Q3 instead of Q1 the following year."

Speed to market compounds. The longer you wait to ship, the more customer feedback you miss, the slower you iterate. In India's hyper-competitive SaaS landscape, that delay is often fatal.

## What About User Experience?

The "but native feels better" argument held water in 2021. In 2026, it's mostly cope.

**PWAs now support:**
- Push notifications (98% of Android users, 87% of iOS users via Safari)
- Offline functionality with service workers
- Native share sheets and shortcuts
- Biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint)
- Camera and file access with Web APIs
- Background sync for data-heavy apps

Compare that to what most B2B SaaS apps actually use from native APIs, and the gap is negligible. Unless you're building CAD software or video editing tools, PWA capabilities cover 95% of use cases.

Freshworks' mobile usage data tells the story: After migrating key features to PWA in late 2024, their "app feel" satisfaction scores (measured via in-app surveys) dropped only 4%, while development velocity increased 67%.

Users care about fast, reliable, and functional. They don't care about the technical implementation—especially in B2B contexts where the JTBD is "approve this expense report" not "experience delightful animations."

## The Regulatory Tailwind

India's Digital Competition Bill, currently in draft form as of February 2026, proposes mandatory sideloading support and prohibitions on anti-steering clauses. If passed, Apple and Google would have to allow third-party payment processors without penalties.

But here's the twist: Indian SaaS companies aren't waiting for regulatory wins. They're routing around the problem entirely.

"We assumed the law would change eventually, but we needed distribution today," says Karthik Reddy, founder of Fieldforce.ai, a field sales automation tool. "PWAs gave us that without asking permission."

This is classic Indian market behavior—when infrastructure doesn't exist, build your own pipes. Reliance Jio did it with telecom. Paytm did it with digital payments. Now SaaS is doing it with distribution.

## The Counterargument: When Native Still Wins

PWAs aren't a silver bullet. Certain categories still demand native:

1. **Consumer social apps** — where brand presence in app stores matters for discovery
2. **Gaming** — where performance and monetization are heavily app-store-dependent
3. **Apps requiring deep OS integration** — health data, advanced camera features, continuous background processes
4. **Products targeting US/European enterprises** — where iOS market share is 45%+ and IT policies favor MDM-managed native apps

But for Indian B2B SaaS? Those edge cases are rare.

Postman, valued at $5.6B, still has a downloadable app but built their core collaboration features as web-first. Freshworks went public with a web-first strategy. Zoho's been preaching it for years. The pattern is clear.

## What This Means for 2026 and Beyond

If you're an Indian SaaS founder deciding on mobile strategy today:

**Choose native if:**
- You're targeting US/EU markets where iOS is 40%+ of users
- Your app fundamentally requires native APIs (AR, advanced camera, health integrations)
- You have significant funding and can afford dedicated iOS/Android teams
- App Store SEO is a primary acquisition channel

**Choose PWA if:**
- Your primary market is India or emerging markets
- You're pre-Series A and capital-efficient
- Your users are businesses, not consumers
- Speed to market matters more than perfect native polish
- You want to avoid the 30% tax and app review delays

The decision tree isn't "either/or" forever—it's "what do we ship first?" And increasingly, Indian startups are betting on web-first, then native when economics justify it.

## The Bigger Picture

What's happening in India isn't just about cost optimization. It's a preview of how emerging markets leapfrog established playbooks.

Just as India skipped landlines for mobile and skipped credit cards for UPI, it's now skipping native apps for PWAs. The infrastructure is good enough, the economics make sense, and the user behavior supports it.

Western SaaS companies still optimizing for App Store rankings might look at India and see corner-cutting. They're missing the pattern.

India isn't behind. It's just solving different constraints—and finding cheaper, faster paths to the same outcomes.

When the next billion SaaS users come online in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, they'll face the same math Indian founders are running today. And they'll likely reach the same conclusion: the app stores are optional, not inevitable.

## Key Takeaways

- 67% of Indian B2B SaaS companies now prioritize PWAs over native apps (up from 22% in 2024)
- App store fees represent 2-3 months of runway for typical Indian startups at current burn rates
- UPI's web-first architecture made payment processing viable outside app stores
- Enterprise buyers actively prefer web-based tools for security and deployment speed
- PWA development costs average 70-80% less than native apps in India's talent market
- Regulatory changes may favor open distribution, but startups aren't waiting

**What's your mobile strategy in 2026?** If you're building in India, the data suggests betting on web-first isn't just viable—it's increasingly the default. The question isn't whether PWAs can compete with native. It's whether native can justify its premium.

For most Indian B2B SaaS companies, the answer is increasingly no.
